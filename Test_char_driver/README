To compile this kernel module, first you must have the kernel sources you want
to build against setup correctly.  Please see the Linux kernel documentation
within the Linux source directory Documentation/kbuild/ for more information.

Then, to build this kernel module, simply execute (but replace the path with
your path to your correctly setup Linux kernel source code):

make -C <path/to/linux/kernel/sources> M=$PWD
