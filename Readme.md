#Exposing the PRU as an I2C and SPI Master Controller. 
This is the repository having all the source code for the project done under BeagleBoard.org for Google Summer Of Code-2016

Please see the [wiki](https://github.com/chanakya-vc/PRU-I2C_SPI_master/wiki) for a detailed documentation on the project.

The folder Test_char_driver contains a test driver that I wrote to test the efficiency of iowrite8() and ioread8() during the course of GSOC.
